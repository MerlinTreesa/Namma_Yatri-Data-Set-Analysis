Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling duplicates, null values, and standardizing formats).
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations like heatmaps, bar plots, and boxplots.
Insights into cancellation rates, driver earnings, and trip conversions across cities.
Statistical summaries and outlier detection.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and MySQL.
